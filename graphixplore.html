                    </div>
                    <p>Design instructors at Valencia College observed a recurring issue:  many graphic and interactive design students lacked participation in the real world design community. Students often lacked motivation to pursue creative work beyond assigned coursework, largely because they didn’t know where to find local design events or opportunities to connect with professionals.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, many students expressed a desire for meaningful feedback. This gap between classroom learning and real-world engagement highlighted the need for a solution that could better support students’ growth, motivation, and professional connection.</p>

                    <p>In this project, we are designing for interactive and graphic design students, faculty, and alumni. The target audience is typically in the age range of 18-28 years old. Users of the app are likely <b>very tech savvy</b> as graphic and interactive design students regularly work using computers and design programs. The biggest frustration among the target user base is the lack of outreach for local design events.</p>

                    <img class="inspo-img" src="images/inspo.png" alt="research and inspiration photos">
                    <h3>Designing User Flows</h3>
                    <p>A major step of the process involved creating user flows specifically for the three major interactive features of the app, which are the Interactive Event Map, Portfolio Space, and Monthly Design Challenge.</p>
                    <img class="flows-img" src="images/user-flows.png" alt="user flows">
                    <h3>Turning User Flows into Wireframe Sets</h3>
                    <p>The next step of the design process were to create low-fidelity wireframe sets to visualize the key screens from our user flows. This stage helped validate the overall functionality before moving into high-fidelity design. Below are examples of select screens from the three major interactive features.</p>

                    <p>The final prototype transforms earlier concepts and wireframes into a cohesive, high-fidelity experience.  With completed visuals, branding, and interactive flows, it demonstrates how the app would function in practice and brings the design vision to life. Below are the three main features of the app.</p>

                    <h3>What I learned while working on GraphiXplore</h3>
                    <p>Working on this project, I learned the importance of designing flows that feel intuitive to users and the importance of designing a product that is enjoyable for your target audience to use. Professor feedback suggested that some sections of the app should be made clear what their function is. With more time, I would definitely add more necessary details to flows and create more clarity in certain sections of the app.</p>
